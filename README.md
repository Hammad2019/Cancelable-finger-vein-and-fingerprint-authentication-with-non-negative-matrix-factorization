This Code represents a novel cancelable multibiometric method that utilizes non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and a lightweight deep learning model to augment the levels of security and privacy in biometric authentication. The proposed system leverages the distinct capabilities of finger vein and fingerprint recognition modalities to enhance authentication accuracy and improve resistance against spoofing attacks. The implementation of cancelable biometrics principles serves to safeguard user privacy and enhance security measures.
